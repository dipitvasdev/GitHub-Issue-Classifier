# üöÄ GitHub Issue Classifier

## Overview

This project is a GitHub Issue Classifier that leverages machine learning to categorize GitHub issues into different types such as bug, enhancement, and question. The model is trained using the dataset `github-labels-top3-803k-train.tar.gz` and `test.tar.gz`. Initially, the model was trained on Databricks (GCP Compute) using PySpark and scikit-learn. Due to limited resources on Databricks, the deployment was transitioned to PythonAnywhere, maintaining consistent functionality. The classifier achieves 85% accuracy using Logistic Regression.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Training on Databricks with PySpark**: Utilizes PySpark for scalable model training on Databricks.
- **Logistic Regression**: Achieves 85% accuracy in classifying GitHub issues.
- **PythonAnywhere Deployment**: Deployed on PythonAnywhere for consistent and reliable model inference.
- **Flask Integration**: The model inference is served through a Flask API.
- **React Frontend**: A React-based frontend to interact with the model and visualize predictions.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `Header.js`: Displays the header of the application with the model training information.
- `Form.js`: Contains the form to input issue details and get predictions.
- `Loader.js`: Displays a loading animation while waiting for model predictions.
- `Notice.js`: Displays a banner notification regarding the deployment shift.
- `api/run-py-model.js`: Handles API requests to the Flask backend running the scikit-learn model.
- `api/trigger-job.js`: Manages API requests to Databricks to trigger job runs and fetch results.
